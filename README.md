# AlphaLight-Cogs
This is the home of the cogs that I am creating for Alpha Light's bot

I am integrating with the [Red-DiscordBot](https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot)

## Working Cogs
Currently the only working cog is the [alphafun](https://github.com/tjphillipsii/AlphaLight-Cogs/tree/master/alphafun) cog, which contains a couple of fun things the clan likes.

## Non-Working Cogs
Any other cog you may find here is very much not working... they are works in progress

### destiny Cog
This cog will be tying into the [bungie.net api](https://github.com/Bungie-net/api)
The plan if there is one, is to:
	- Allow users to verify their bungie account with the server
		- Pull their stats, from a pre-defined list
		- Pull their milestone
	- Allow users to pull the Clan miles stones
	- Get information on the current events/burns in D2

I am still working out the details.
